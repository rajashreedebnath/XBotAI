# XBotAi

An application where the user can chat with an AI model. Beyond this, the user should be able to give some feedback at each stage of the conversation.


 - The user should be able to like/dislike the AI model's answer using the thumbs up/thumbs down buttons. These buttons are hidden and float when the mouse hovers over the AI model's response.

  - The user should be able to give a rating out of 5 at the end of the conversation. You can get creative here and use a likert scale, or 5 stars, etc.

 - The user should be able to give subjective feedback at the end of the conversation.

 ### Component Overview
 - The bot AI page displays the following elements:

 - The user should be able to have multiple conversations.
 - Once the user is done having that conversation, the chat gets saved. This chat can be revisited from a panel on the side/top bar.
 - While viewing a past conversation, the user should also be able to see the feedback provided.
 - There should be another view where the user can see all feedback points across conversations and filter them based on rating.
